## ðŸŽ† Welcome ðŸŽ†


### Premise ðŸŽˆ

Technological change is inherent to human progress. Technology, by definition, serves to augment human capacities and in so doing alters the environment in which we act. In a very real way, social reality and technology co-evolve or are co-constructed.  Technology is a dominant fashioner of reality, influencing social arrangements, goals, and assumptions in a way that profoundly affects collective development, individual behaviour, and the ecosystems upon which we depend. 


### Technological Choice ðŸŽˆ

How can individuals and communities be empowered to make meaningful choices about technology? How do we move from being passive technological users or subjects to active agents in constructively shaping patterns of technological development? Clearly, developing the capacity for technological assessment, innovation, and adaptation is vital to social progress. This requires the creation of grassroots, participatory mechanisms that foster a dynamic process of learning about technology. It entails the creation of consultative social spaces where communities can evaluate technological needs, options, and impacts. In short, we need to create opportunities at all levels of society that allow us to consciously build ways of life that integrate technology into a desirable conception of what it is to be human.


### Vision ðŸŽˆ

**Our vision is to make technology universally accessible. We are building a new tech ecosystem that connects people and give them the tools to build their own systems of innovation and solutions empowering technological choice.**

We envisioned an openÂ social technology platform focused on **collaboration and building tools the empower technological choice**. Our mission is toÂ **connect an expanding network**Â of people,Â experts, industry leaders and investors to help **source and build tools that elevate innovations** across the world, and have a real impact on the futureÂ **social and economic development**. A Tech Ecosystem that fosters the **creation, application, and diffusion of knowledge, tools, techniques and practices that lies at the heart of social progress.** By encouragingÂ **the creativity and expertise of grassroots protagonist**Â who can meaningfully contribute to local advancements. Through collaborative action, our platform aspiresÂ to nurtureÂ **a world where anyone can learn and with ideas is empowered to create tools and solutions address the worldâ€™s most pressing challenges.**


### Principles ðŸŽˆ

***To augment human capacity and thus advance social well-being and innovation.***

**EpistÄ“mÄ“:** *principled system of understanding*

**TechnÄ“:** *a craft or applied practice*


### ðŸŽ‡ RoadMap (5 Year Plan) ðŸŽ‡
